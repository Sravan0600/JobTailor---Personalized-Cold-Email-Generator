# JobTailor---Personalized-Cold-Email-Generator
JobTailor is a web application that generates personalized cold emails based on job descriptions extracted from URLs. The system uses your portfolio to tailor emails with relevant skills and project links, helping you craft highly targeted job applications.

How the Project Works
Job Description Extraction: The app extracts the job details from a user-provided URL.
Data Cleaning: The job description is cleaned to remove unnecessary HTML and irrelevant content.
Portfolio Matching: The userâ€™s portfolio (stored in a CSV file) is queried for skills and project links that match the job description.
Cold Email Generation: A personalized cold email draft is generated, which highlights relevant skills and links to your portfolio projects.
UI Interaction: The user interface, built with Streamlit, allows easy interaction where users input URLs and view the generated emails.
Technologies Used
LangChain: Used to build logic for job description extraction and email generation.
GroqCloud LLM: A language model for processing job descriptions and drafting personalized cold emails.
ChromaDB: A vector database that stores the user's portfolio and retrieves matching projects based on job description skills.
Streamlit: The front-end interface that allows users to input job URLs and view the generated emails.
